all extra stats will be determined by weapons alone. No stats for gaining levels.
No stats for armor.
classes will be based on equipment. players can specify what they want in weapons
a list will be numbered one to five, and plays can fill the spots in order 
of what stats they want in weapons. 1 will always have the highest value in 
weapons they find, 5 will have the lowest. 

there will be two modes: dungeons and the arena 
The arena being the main focus of the game, and dungeons with simple maps
that branch out in order to find items 

Your skill is dependant on class. Your moves are dependant of your items and 
what scrolls you've found. 

There is no penalty for dying in the arena, but dying in the dungeon will take
you back to the beginning. 

Two of the same weapon can have different values.
